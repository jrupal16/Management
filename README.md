# Midterm-Management-Application

I have create a Midterm Management Application to assist all groups with managing their presentations.

This application should provide the following functionality:

## Create & Manage Groups:

 - A group is a collection of Students.
 - A group should have a Node Module associated with it.
 - A group should have a "Description" property that outlines the module that is being presented.
 - This application should allow Students to be added/removed from a group
 - app should allow groups to be deleted
 
## Tasks:

 -  application should allow new tasks to be created.
 -  application should allow tasks to be assigned to individual members of a team.
 -  app should allow tasks to be marked as done, not-done, and also be deleted.
